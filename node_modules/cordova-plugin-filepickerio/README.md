Plugin for Cordova to use the [native android SDK](https://github.com/Ink/filepicker-android) and the [native iOS SDK](https://github.com/filestack/FSPicker) of [FileStack (formerly filepicker.io)](https://www.filestack.com/) 

## Installing the plugin ##
```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-filepickerio --save
```

## Using the plugin ##
The plugin creates the object `window.filepicker` with the following functions available:

 * `filepicker.setKey(key)`
 * `filepicker.setName(app_name)` // not supported on iOS
 * `filepicker.pick(picker_options, onSuccess(Blob){}, onError(FPError){})`
 * `filepicker.pickMultiple(picker_options, onSuccess(Blobs){}, onError(FPError){})`
 * `filepicker.pickAndStore(picker_options, store_options, onSuccess(Blobs){}, onError(FPError){})`

### Response format ##
 * `container` - container in S3 where the file was stored (if it was stored)
 * `url` - file link to uploaded file
 * `filename` - name of file
 * `localPath` - local path of file // not returned on iOS
 * `key` - unique key
 * `mimetype` - mimetype
 * `size` - size in bytes

note: `pick()` returns an object, `pickMultiple()` and `pickAndStore()` returns an array of objects

### Picker options available ##
 * ```multiple``` boolean : Getting multiple files
 * ```maxFiles``` integer : Choosing max files
 * ```maxSize``` integer : Choosing max files // not supported on iOS
 * ```services``` array of strings : Choosing services ```{"GALLERY", "CAMERA", "FACEBOOK", "CLOUDDRIVE", "DROPBOX", "BOX", "GMAIL", "INSTAGRAM", "FLICKR", "PICASA", "GITHUB", "GOOGLE_DRIVE", "EVERNOTE", "SKYDRIVE"}```
 * ```mimeTypes``` array of strings : Choosing mimetypes


### Store options available ##
 * ```location``` string : `S3`, `azure`, `dropbox`, `rackspace`, `gcs` 
 * ```path``` string : Choosing the path ```"/example/123.png"```
 * ```container``` string : Bucket
 * ```access``` string :  ```public```

### Theming ##
Not implemented yet, feel free to contribute. See [native SDK documentation](https://github.com/filestack/FSPicker#fstheme).

## Difference between iOS and Android

 * `filepicker.setName(name)` is not supported on iOS
 * the `maxSize` picker options is not supported on iOS
 * the `localPath` property is not returned on iOS
 * the property `picker_options.multiple` for the `filepicker.pickAndStore()` function have different default value. On android, it is `false` by default. On iOS, it is `true`.

## Full example

A full example could be:

```
function pickFile() {
    window.filepicker.setKey('APP KEY');
    window.filepicker.setName('APP NAME');
    window.filepicker.pickAndStore({
        multiple: true,
        mimeTypes: ['image/*', 'application/pdf'],
        services : [ 'CAMERA', 'GALLERY', 'GOOGLE_DRIVE', 'DROPBOX', 'BOX', 'SKYDRIVE'],
        maxFiles: 20,
        maxSize: (10*1024*1024)
    }, {
        location : 'S3',
        path : '/location/'
    }, function(res) {
        console.log(res);
    }, function(e) {
       console.error(e);
    });
}
```

### Finding something to do

Ask, or pick an issue and comment on it announcing your desire to work on it. Ideally wait until we assign it to you to minimize work duplication.

### Reporting an issue

- Search existing issues before raising a new one.

- Include as much detail as possible.

### Pull requests

- Make it clear in the issue tracker what you are working on, so that someone else doesn't duplicate the work.

- Use a feature branch, not master.

- Rebase your feature branch onto origin/master before raising the PR.

- Keep up to date with changes in master so your PR is easy to merge.

- Be descriptive in your PR message: what is it for, why is it needed, etc.

- Make sure the tests pass

- Squash related commits as much as possible.

### Coding style

- Try to match the existing indent style.
